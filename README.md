# ViT (Vision Transformer)
Vision transformer implementation with python and pure C++

This repo will train/infer on CIFAR10 dataset, which can be downloaded through torchvision.
The `python` module contains the vanilla vision transformer architecture and its training/inference logic.
The same logic is implemented using pure C++ functions.
